* The universities lack the courage to teach hard science;
  they will continue to misguide the students,
  and each stage in the infantilization
  of the curriculum will be hailed
  as educational progress.
  -- Edsger Wybe Dijkstra
* the only way to learn how to create something is to try to create it
