cicada language has its website now!

the ["posts"][home] will be served as a blog of cicada language
to announce interesting news, events and features.
and it will be served as me blog too.

in the ["categories"][categories],
I will arrange reading materials in groups
include documentations and tutorials about cicada language,
and some of my understanding of a few concepts of programming and math.

in the ["source code"][source code],
I will provide some literate-programming source code of cicada language with syntax highlight.

[categories]: /categories
[source code]: /source-code
[home]: /

before trying to creat this site,
I could never figure that it is this easy to make a static website with the help of [github-pages][] and [jekyll][].

[jekyll]:       http://jekyllrb.com
[github-pages]: https://pages.github.com


things always like this right?
you imagined it is so hard to achieve something,
before you get to the right start point to begin with.
you imagined a concept is so hard to be understanded,
before you find the tutorial that introduces it in a right way.

nowadays, with the [free software movement][] and the related [open source movement][]
and many organizations that devoted themself to make the world more international and more open,
one can easily get to a good start point to implement something; one can easily discourse internationally about the things that he or she is interested in; or, toward a specific concept, one can easily find a free tutorial, which is much appropriate than a pedantic college or school, which lower-standarded itself for money, can provide.
be it math, language, web-design, programming language, blues harmonica or hard rock guitar or whatever.

so, let me thank [Hossain Mohammad Faysal][] first, for I use his great code and learn web-design from him.

[Hossain Mohammad Faysal]: http://hmfaysal.github.io/about/

and,

I would like to thank [Dan Friedman][] and [Matthias Felleisen][],
who introduced me to Scheme
and to many of the concepts of functional programming
(by their book [the little schemer][]).
I consider myself as Dan's student,
even he has never and never will meet me.

I would like to thank [Jason Hemann][],
for his invitations and encouragements.

I would like to thank Richard W.M. Jones,
for I learned how to implement a forth-like language
from his [jonesforth][].

I would like to thank Tomasz Grysztar,
for his great [fasm][] assembler.

I would like to thank BAO Hong-ran,
for to design part of the main Chinese syntax.

I would like to thank Ian Seyler,
for his great [BareMetal][],
and I have learned a lot from his code.

现在, cicada 蝉语 有自己的网站了!

["posts"][home] 将作为 蝉语 和 我 的 博客,
我将在这里发布相关的 新闻 和 事件.

在 ["categories"][categories] 中 与 cicada 蝉语 有关的阅读材料 将被分门别类,

在 ["source code"][source code] 中,
还有一些 所谓文学编程的 带有语法高亮的 源代码.

在尝试制作这个网站之前,
我根本想不到现在在 [github-pages][] 和 [jekyll][] 的帮助下,
制作一个静态的网站是如此简单.

很多事情都是如此 不是吗?
你觉的某个东西非常难实现,只因为你没找到合适的入手点;
你觉的某个概念很难理解,只因为你没找到合适的导论.

从来不是因为你没有所谓的 "能力" 和 "潜质",
只要你有兴趣,你就能完成任何事,或学习到任何知识.

大家都知道 [自由软件运动][free software movement] 还有相关的 [开放源代码运动][open source movement],
当然 还有很多的组织 都致力于构建一个国际化的开放的世界
(我现在也相信那 英特纳雄耐尔 一定会实现).
这为有兴趣学习的人提供了,非常理想的学习材料和环境.
想要实现某个想法的人可以很容易的找到合适的入手点;
对共同的理论和技术感兴趣的人们可以很容易地相互交流与讨论;
想要学习某个理论或概念的人也很容易找到自由发布的免费的高质量的导论;
一个良好的开放的社区远比某些学校的课程所能传授的知识要多,
不论是 数学, 语言, 网页设计, 程序语言,
蓝调口琴 或者 金属吉他 或者 任何其他东西.

我还是先谢谢 [Hossain Mohammad Faysal][] 吧,
因为我用了他的代码,并且从他的代码中学习了网页的设计.

还要感谢 [Dan Friedman][] 和 [Matthias Felleisen][],
他们用他们的小人书 [the little schemer][]
引导我进入了 Scheme 和 函数式编程的世界.

还要感谢 [Jason Hemann][] 的热情 邀请 和 鼓励.

还要感谢 Richard W.M. Jones,
因为我从他的 [jonesforth][] 那里学会了如何用汇编实现一个 类 Forth 语言.

还要感谢 Tomasz Grysztar,
因为我使用他的 [fasm][] 汇编器.

还要感谢 鲍鸿然,
因为在跟他的讨论过程中 我们一起设计了 蝉语 的核心中文语法.

还要感谢 Ian Seyler,
为他的 [BareMetal][],
还为我从他的代码中学到的很多东西.
