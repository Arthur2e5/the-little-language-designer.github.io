  * the little nymph is for teaching purpose only
  * it reuses the code and idea
    of the early version of cicada-language
    to teach my friends
    how to implement a interpreter
    of a simple programming language
    (a threaded-code based (Forth-like) language)
  * I will use assembly language (FASM for x86-64)
    to implement the interpreter
  * first version is for linux
    with the help of my firends
    win port and mac port will coming soon
